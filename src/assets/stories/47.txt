# Note from Don Vito (DE) / Daikiri (FR) in Cumhuriyet

for a while everything was fine

we had a bottle of wine,

a cigar balanced on an ashtray,

and some of this nothingness in hour hands

  


hand is dirty

assure self, assure all

  


crap, it's all star shit and all beauty belongs to destructive, though the object responsible is destructed at that moment in space and time.

  


crap space

shrink-wrap time
